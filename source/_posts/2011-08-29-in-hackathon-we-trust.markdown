<p>Spread the word : Geeks are not living in caves anymore !! Or at least they going out from their caves to see the sunlight once in a while for a specific occasion. Something in between a computer science class, a LAN party, a crazy scientist lab and a networking event.</p>


<p>If you are part of the geek crowd you understood that I was talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" hreflang="en" title="Hackathon">Hackathons</a>.</p>


<p>For those who don't know what what is it, let's make it easy :</p>


<h2>Hackathon = Hack + athon = Hack marathon</h2>


<p>Hack ? Wooo... like Hackers ? Cracking credit card, launching NASA spaceship or changing traffic lights ?</p>


<p>No, nothing like that. It is about Hacking but in a good way. People are building awesome products to solve problems or just for the fun of programming.</p>


<p>This kind of events is very tech oriented, so if you are not a programmer it could be hard to attend.
People are coming to work on their projects or to build new stuff during the event depends on the kind of event.</p>


<p>Since I moved to San Francisco I already attend to two different Hackathons. The first one was the <a href="http://hapihack.com" hreflang="en" title="HAPIHack">HAPIHack</a> weekend organized by <a href="www.tokbox.com/opentok/api" hreflang="en" title="Opentok">OpenTok</a> at their place. The principle was to create an application using at least one API from the sponsors. At the end of weekend, teams presented their work and a winner per API was designate to win the prize.</p>

<p>During this <a href="http://hapihack.com" hreflang="en" title="HAPIHack">HAPIHack</a> I work with a Spanish mate (<a href="http://twitter.com/plunchete" hreflang="en" title="Plunchete">Ignacio</a>) on an application called <a href="http://facerate.cloudfoundry.com/" hreflang="en" title="FaceRate">FaceRate</a>. <a href="http://facerate.cloudfoundry.com/" hreflang="en" title="FaceRate">FaceRate</a> lets you take a picture of yourself to express your thought about a content (Video, Picture, text...), it is more powerful and meaningful than just a "like" or a "+1".</p>


<p>We used <a href="http://embed.ly" hreflang="en" title="Embed.ly">Embed.ly</a> API to display a content (215 types of content available), <a href="www.tokbox.com/opentok/api" hreflang="en" title="OpenTok API">OpenTok API</a> to take the picture and <a href="http://face.com/" hreflang="en" title="Face.com">Face.com</a> API to analyse your facial expression.</p>


<p>If you would like to try a live demo it's here (might be a bit buggy) : <a href="http://facerate.cloudfoundry.com/">http://facerate.cloudfoundry.com/</a></p>

<p>And the Github repository if you want to fork it. <a href="https://github.com/picsoung/FaceRate" hreflang="en" title="FaceRate on GitHub">FaceRate on Github</a></p>


<p>It was a really nice adventure to work on a new project with somebody I did not know before. He initiate me to<a href="http://playframework.com" hreflang="en"> Play framework</a> that uses Java to build web applications and we were able to win two prizes, an Apple TV from embed.ly and a <a href="http://www.jawbone.com/speakers/jambox/overview" hreflang="en" title="Jambox">JamBox</a> from Face.com.</p>


<p>Hackathons are really a good time to meet people like you (coders), talk about technique, learn new APIs and tech stuff, be efficient (you need a result by the end of the weekend)...</p>

<p>This weekend I attend to the <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.org" hreflang="en" title="SuperHappyDevHouse">SuperHappyDevHouse</a> at the <a href="http://hackerdojo.com" title="HackerDojo">HackerDojo</a> in Mountain View, it was an afternoon+night Hackathon but without competitions or prizes. It was just for the sick of being with others instead of coding in your cave or at a coffee shop.</p>


<p>Special mentions to <a href="http://localno.de/" hreflang="en" title="Localno.de">Localno.de</a> that lets you share your localhost application easily (helpful in dev mode) and to <a href="http://popstardefense.com/play?s" hreflang="en" title="PopStar Defense"></a> for a 100% HTML5 amazing tower defense game.</p>

<p>Hackathons are the new trend around here with at least one every week. It a signs that tech people also need their events to meet others of their kind, so open your eyes more are coming ! Companies also need Hackathons where rockstars (#buzzword) developers will be able to see the limit of the API or ask for new features. And Hackers can help APIs providers in their development process.</p>


<p>So if you are a coder or a student who is learning Computer Science you should definetly attend to the next Hackathon around you, meet others geeks, eat pizza and code :)</p>


<p>PS : companies love if you hacked their API before applying for a job</p>
