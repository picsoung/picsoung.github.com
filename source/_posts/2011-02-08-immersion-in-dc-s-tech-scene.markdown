<p>Having a one week break before the beginning of Spring semester is nice. Visiting DC during this break with friends is super cool. But the best part is attending a Techy networking event in DC while you are on break.
That is what I did two weeks ago. It was the best way to kill two birds with one stone, visiting US's capital and discovering DC's tech scene. So before my journey I simply googled "DC"+"networking event" and in 3 more clicks I found <a href="http://www.techcocktail.com" hreflang="en">TeckCocktail</a>'s event. I booked my ticket, printed it and I was ready to go.</p>


<p>A new adventure for Frenchie :)</p>


<p>Of course the location of the bar(<a href="http://www.slaviya-dc.com/" hreflang="en">Slaviya</a>) where the <a href="http://www.techcocktail.com" hreflang="en">TechCocktail</a> took place was not in my tiny tourist map. But I found it without difficulty after a 40 minute walk from the subway station.
It was a nice and classy bar with demo tables all around it. I was there in advance but it became crowded quickly. It was time to meet people :) .</p>


<p>I was impressed to see how simple it was to meet people. I had no reason to feel uncomfortable, because people were so welcoming. You just have to take the first step and you can meet interesting people easily.
It was a good opportunity to see that DC is not only a government city but also an entrepreneurial city with many good ideas.</p>


<p>I do not know if it is what we call the "American Dream", but after this event I felt that everything is possible, you can a great idea and build it, and there is a community who can help you by giving you some advice and sharing their experiences.</p>


<p>The French tech scene is in expansion, and unfortunately I am not studing in a big city in France, but I hope we have events like <a href="http://www.techcocktail.com" hreflang="en">TechCocktail</a> to meet other entrepreneurs and demo products.</p>


<p>In my opinion it is the perfect place to be as a student. This kind of event helps you to develop your own entrepreneurial fiber and give you a showcase of what is going on around you. If you are a computer science major like me, that will broaden your mind on where you would like to work. Forget giants companies, your local tech scene has so much to offer ;)</p>


<p>Unfortunately good things come to an end; it was time for me to leave and go back to Minnesota for school.
I will for sure attend another <a href="http://www.techcocktail.com" hreflang="en">TechCocktail</a> if I have the opportunity again.</p>


<p>PS : I add a new geek shirt to my collection :)</p>
