<p>Finally after 4hours of waiting from 6 in the morning to 10 i'm In !!!!
It was really coool i met funny guys, two teens and two adults and we spend all the tail together.
It's hard to say how cool it was, something amazing. We all have something in common, we love that and we speak about it during 4hours :)</p>


<p>Seven years of waiting for the crazy stuff&nbsp;!</p>


<p>Happy like nobody else to be on the place :)</p>


<p>Got my unique shirt but no gift pack :(</p>


<p>The new Magic Mouse is really fun, too cool in the hand
