<p>Last weekend I attended my 3rd Startup Weekend but this time I was part of the facilitators. This one was focused on Mobile and was held at the AT&amp;T Foundry (awesome building !!).</p>

<p>After being a part of <a href="http://ditchthetourbus.com" title="DitchTheTourBus">DitchTheTourBus</a> project in November 2010 during Startup Weekend Twin Cities and attenting the Mega SW in Mountain View, CA couple of months ago; I decided to help and join the SW bay team to make these events happen.</p>


<p>It's a really interesting experience to be on the other side. You can help teams to go on the right path and be focused on key points. My ultimate goal is to bring Startup Weekend in the East part of France, where there is (beside of Strasbourg) a lack of this kind of events.</p>


<p>So during the weekend I tried my best to help teams, especially teams that did not have enough time to work on app to demo or to build a website. I shared with them couple of wireframing tools like <a href="http://balsamiq.com" hreflang="en">Balsamiq</a>, <a href="https://gomockingbird.com/" hreflang="en">Mockingbird</a> or <a href="http://mockflow.com">Mockflow</a>.</p>


<p>But I also tried to make the part 2 of a previous article I wrote on my blog couple of months ago.</p>


<p>This article should help StartupWeekend teams but also small startups to create an easy nice-looking website/launch page in less than an hour.
You can find the first part of the article about which tools we are going to use here&nbsp;: <a href="/index.php?post/Create-a-startup-webpage-in-less-than-1-hour-Tools">create a startup webpage in less than 1 hour - tools</a></p>


<p>The second part is contains in this screencast that shows all the different steps to create your launch page.</p>


<p>Check it out :) And let me know what you think about it, feel free to ask any questions in the comment section :)</p>
